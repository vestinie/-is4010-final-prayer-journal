# AI-Assisted Development Documentation

## AI Tools Used

### Claude (Anthropic)
- **Primary tool**: Used throughout the entire development process
- **URL**: https://claude.ai

## How AI Was Used

### Code Generation
- Helped Create the `PrayerJournal` class 
- Helped Build the command-line interface using `argparse`
- Helped Generate comprehensive test suite with pytest

### Debugging and Problem Solving
- Helped troubleshoot Python installation and command issues (using `py` instead of `python`)
- Assisted with file path issues in Windows/OneDrive environment
- Guided through VS Code setup and navigation

### Learning New Concepts
- Explained how to structure a CLI application
- Taught pytest fixtures and testing best practices
- Showed how to use argparse for command-line arguments
- Demonstrated JSON file I/O for data persistence

## Helpful Prompts

Some effective prompts I used:

1. "Help me build a Prayer Journal CLI application step by step"
2. "The command isn't working - I'm getting this error: [error message]"
3. "How do I test this functionality with pytest?"

## Impact on Development

### Positive Impacts
- **Speed**: Completed the project much faster than I could have alone
- **Learning**: Learned proper project structure and testing practices
- **Confidence**: AI guidance helped me understand each step instead of just copying code
- **Quality**: Generated professional-level code with good practices

### Challenges
- Had to troubleshoot environment-specific issues (Windows paths, Python commands)
- Needed to understand what the AI-generated code was doing

## Reflection

Using AI assistance was extremely helpful for this project. Instead of getting stuck on syntax or structure, I could focus on understanding how CLI applications work and how to test them properly. The step-by-step approach helped me learn while building, rather than just copying a tutorial.

The most valuable aspect was having immediate help when I encountered errors, rather than spending hours searching Stack Overflow or documentation.
